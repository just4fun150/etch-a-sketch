# **Etch-A-Sketch**
TOP's etch-a-sketch project.

 ### **Difficulty** 
- Took me a while to figure out why there was a gray effect at the bottom of the grid container but turns out it was because I wasn't clearing the previous grid before creating a new one and the old grid was being pushed to the bottom of the new one.



### **What i learnt** 

- How to clear DOM element.
- How to change and set CSS property with the `.setProperty` method.
